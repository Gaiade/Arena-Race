# GAÏADE - Arena Shooter Race

Our first (who are we kidding) project is a 3D Arena Shooter Race based on the concept of [Death Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Race_(film)). It will feature 2 teams of 8 prisoners racing and
fighting in an arena for their liberty. When a prisoner dies in the race, another one takes his place.
The winning team is the one that loses the fewest members, then or the one that had the fastest run
through the arena (in case of equal casualties).

The mood of the game is inspired by DOOM and Quake. The game mechanics are also inspired by Nexuiz and
Counter Strike games (mostly older ones). here are a few points discussed while initiating the project:

* The starting idea of this game is to have 2 players (1v1) playing against eachother, each controlling
a team of prisoners;
* Network was first thought as being peer-to-peer;
* At first, the game is going to be using UFPS, USFX and Realistic effects pack assets;
* The game will use Wwise as it's audio controller;
* Levels could be composed of only fighting arenas, or arenas connected together with racing tracks full
of T̸͕̀R̶̩̎͋A̶̛̱͈̔P̶̙͝S̵̮͖͌s and Ď̵̝E̸̤͛̂Å̴̲͍T̷̩̟̅̅H̸̘̓ ̶̥͊P̷͉̾Ï̴̹̬T̵̪͗Š̸̨̕;
* Maps would have Health and Armor collectible, Armor adding extra, tougher life to the player;
* Teleportation and jump pads will be implemented;
* The game is not instagib, it features (at first) 3 different weapons, infinite ammo, needs reload / cooldown:

  * A Special weapon found in the arena, win the race to have the chance to hold the [Ǩ̸̡̛̥̹̦͈̞̖̣̞̺̘̯͔͂͊́̅̽͊̅̏̽̄̕͝Å̷̡̢̢͖̻͕͙̹̣͕͉̑̾̆͆͆̐̄ͅT̵̨̢̼̦̰̬̘̫̲̀͋̑͑̇̑̕͝͝͝ͅĄ̸̮̻͉͍̭͓̲̜̯̓͌͊̿̉́̎͊͆͆̈́́̉͂̎͜͝N̸̡͕̳͍͇̳̟̜̳̻̮̘̟̣̰̰̖̭̫̒̍̏̀̈́̃̎̍̐̅̊̀͌̔͛̀͑̋́͛̋̄̕̚̕̕͝͠͠ͅͅḀ̶̧̧̨̧̟̤͈̬̝̜̹̖̟͙͔̘̞̳̙̪̺͙̍̍͑͌̀̏͌̓̆̃̑͊̊̽̏͛̍̑͛͘͠
